              I got Digital Specialist Engineer(DSE) at Infosys through Off-Campus Recruitment Drive. First-round was a coding round followed by a technical interview. 
Online coding round: There were three questions. One easy(Based on hashmap), one medium(based on DP), and one hard(Based on DP). I was able to solve one question 100%, one 14%, and one 10%.In the coding round, I would like to give you a suggestion that it might happen that initially, you couldn’t crack the logic but you should not quit and give your effort till the last moment.
After almost one month my Interview was scheduled for 8 March 2022.
Technical Interview: The interviewer asked me the following questions:
·        Introduce yourself.
·        Rate yourself out of 10 in Java
·        Then he asked some core java questions
o   what is copied, constructor? (answered)
o   what is Clone()  in java? (answered)
o   What is a package? (answered)
o   What is Applet? (not answered)
o   Can we overload the main method? (answered)
o   Can we override the main method? (answered)
then he asked me two basic coding questions.
·        Remove all duplicate elements from a string? (He told me to only tell logic. I told logic using Hash set and he agreed.)
·              2. Find the occurrence of all elements in a string? (I told him the logic using Hash Map.)
Then he asked me basic questions related to the Internship as I had mentioned in the introduction part.
·        What is Spring MVC?
·        What is JPA?
·        What is REST API?

              Hi! I have been selected for TCS from our campus placements. Here is how I prepared and how the recruitment process took place.
Where did I prepare from?
I was trained by FACE in my college. They have provided me with materials for TCS preparation. About 90% of the questions were repeated from their materials. I have also prepared from their site faceprep.in and other sites like m4maths.com. These are the best sites for TCS preparation.
TCS conducted 3 rounds in our college
•	Online test Round
•	Technical Round + Managerial Round
•	HR Round
Online test: The online test had 5 sections. Aptitude, verbal, logical, email writing, and C MCQ questions. Email writing was easy. There were hints given and we need to use each of these and write an email. C MCQ questions were very simple and repeated from FACE materials.
Technical Round + Managerial Round The students who cleared the online test were called for an interview.
HR Round: This is the final round of the recruitment process. The questions were very simple and focused to test my communication skills. A few of them were:
1.	Are you a team member or a team leader
2.	Tell me about yourself
3.	How do you handle situations when two of your teammates have quarrels.
4.	Your hobbies
5.	Walk me through your resume
The interview went smoothly as the recruiters were very patient and polite.

              I applied for the Application Developer role on their website. After 1 Month they have scheduled a Cognitive and Technical Assessment Round. For that particular Round, you will receive the result within 5 minutes. Selected candidates will undergo a Coding Exam which contains 2 coding questions with moderate level difficulty. The one who executes both the programs will shortlist for further Rounds. After coding there will be Communication Assessment where they will check your fluency and etc. Once you are done with the communication assessment later within a few days you will receive an e-mail to schedule your Virtual interview with Accenture. The interview contains more technical questions related to your resume and skillsets.
Round 1:Cognitive and Technical Assessment: It contains questions from quants, reasoning, and technical questions like networking, operating systems, and cloud computing.
Round 2: Coding Round: There were two coding questions of moderate level. One question was based on loops and one question was based on arrays.
Round 3: Communicative Assessment: Mostly in this round we had to read the given sentences. This was not an elimination round though, while the previous two were.
Round 4: Final Interview Round: Duration (20-30 mins)
